# Linear-Regression-using-Python
Introduction:
Linear Regression is one of the easiest and most popular Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. It is a technique for predicting a target value using independent factors. Linear Regression is mostly used for forecasting and determining cause and effect relationships among variables. Based on the number of independent variables, a linear regression can be divided into two main categories:
•	Simple Linear Regression: In simple Linear regression, where there is only one dependent and one corresponding independent variable. That means there is only one possible output Y for every input variable X.
•	Multiple Linear Regression: There are multiple independent variables and one corresponding dependent variable in multiple linear regression. That means for every output variable Y, there are more than one input variable Xi.

In this project, I have discussed Linear regression, its implementation and evaluations using different methods.
Skills used: 
•	Pandas
•	Numpy 
•	Sklearn
